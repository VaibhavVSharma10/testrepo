data scientist is not a “we need this so please get it done” kind of job. I, as a data scientist, am highly included in the decision process. This is because data scientist is the one with the expertise but also because what I’m doing has to perfectly align with reality. If my model is not perfectly tuned with reality, it is very hard to use it in real life. So it is important, and fun, to make sure you talk to nearly everyone involved in a project and make sure you have a good overall understanding of the problem at hand.
